# Developer Setup & Project Conventions

> Step-by-step: how to get the code, set it up, run it, and where things live in the repo. Reduces setup time for new contributors and TAs and avoids “works on my machine.”

## Quick start (step-by-step)
1. Clone the repo
2. Install prerequisites
3. Configure environment
4. Run locally
5. Run tests

## Prerequisites
- Runtime(s): TBD
- Package manager(s): TBD
- Database(s): TBD
- Tooling (Docker/Make/etc.): TBD

## Clone and setup
```bash
git clone TBD
cd TBD
TBD
```

## Environment variables
- `TBD` = TBD
- `TBD` = TBD

## Run locally
```bash
# start deps
TBD

# run app
TBD
```

## Repo layout (conventions)
- `/src`: TBD
- `/docs`: TBD
- `/scripts`: TBD
- `/infra`: TBD

## Wiki editing workflow (optional but recommended)
- Decide whether edits happen in GitHub UI or via a local git workflow.
- If using git locally, clone the wiki repo and push changes to the default branch to publish.
