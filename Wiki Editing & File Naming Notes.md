# Wiki Editing & File Naming Notes

## Key platform rules that affect page titles
- GitHub wiki page names come from filenames.
- Filenames should avoid: `\ / : * ? " < > |`.
- For rubric-required titles that include `/`, keep filenames safe and use `\[\[Page Name|Display Text\]\]` plus the page H1 to show the exact title.

## Local workflow (optional)
1. Create an initial wiki page in GitHub UI.
2. Clone the wiki repository locally, edit files, and push to the default branch to publish.
