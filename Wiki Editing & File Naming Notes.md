# Wiki Editing & File Naming Notes

## Key platform rules that affect page titles
- Wiki page titles are determined by filenames.
- Avoid these characters in page titles/filenames: `\ / : * ? " < > |`.

## Local workflow (optional)
1. Create an initial wiki page in GitHub UI.
2. Clone the wiki repository locally, edit files, and push to the default branch to publish.
